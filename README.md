Hey! Where's the drum?
Oooh girl ya shining
Like a 5th avenue diamond
And they don't make you
like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way ya save me
Who can blame me
When I just wanna make ya smile
I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss ya like Prince
Let's get it on like
Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway write a song
for you like this
Ya over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born
in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in
a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you,
Baby you're so classic
4 dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style
I'm a pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman bringing
glamour back
Keep it reel to reel in
the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle
I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss ya like Prince
Let's get it on like
Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway write a song
for you like this
Ya over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born
in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
everything is so throw back-ish
(I kinda like it)
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind
living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're class
and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you
ever 'til we met
A star in the 40s,
center fold in the 50s
Got me trippin' out like 60s
Hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, Beyonce,
Marilyn Massive
Girl you're timeless,
just so classic
Ya over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born
in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
everything is so throw back-ish
(I kinda like it)
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind
living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic...
