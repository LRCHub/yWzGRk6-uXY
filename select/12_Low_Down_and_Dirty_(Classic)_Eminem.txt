She went into the graveyard with trouble on her mind.
She was lookin' for the man who make her crazy.
From her big brown coat she puller a silver knife.
As she held it in her hand, her heart was racing.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay i'll never find my way back home.

Its been nine long years since you took my hand.
I'll never understand what made you do it,
And how you twisted up my soul, through me in a hole.
I didn't come this far to see you through it

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay i'll never find my way back home.

Babe, I'm sorry for you, but it's what I have to do.
You died that night beneath the leaves have fallen,
And the devil will stand by; smilin' bright, his pitchfork high.
A ghost from all these graves will come a callin'.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do.
If I stay i'll never find my way back home.

So she stabbed him in the heart.
Her shinning blade it ripped apart
His skin and pierced thought the center,
And I lay my body down, through me on the ground,
And cover me so I can hide from my dominator.

You're low down and dirty,
So low down.

You're low down and dirty, and I love the way you do. (x3)
If I stay i'll never find my way back home,
