[00:31.14] In my neighborhood,
[00:39.61] When shots go off,
[00:44.35] No one bothers.
[00:50.80] A POP, and a reply POP, and no reply...
[01:10.30] 
[01:02.68] Dinosaurs on the quilt I wore
[01:07.97] With a girl.
[01:12.68] Such a classic girl...
[01:24.24] Such a classic girl...
[01:38.78] Such a classic girl,
[01:48.78] 
[01:47.02] Gives her man great ideas.
[01:53.85] Hears you tell your friends,
[01:56.66] Hey man, listen to my great idea!
[02:04.71] It's true I am a villain
[02:07.95] When you fall ill,
[02:10.35] That's probably because
[02:21.85] 
[02:16.33] Men never can be.
[02:21.08] Not like a girl.
[02:26.84] A classic girl...
[02:37.59] Such a classic girl...
[02:48.59] 
[02:57.72] They may say, Those were the days...,
[03:17.24] But in a way,
[03:20.18] You know for us these are the days.
[03:28.05] Yes, for us these are the days,
[03:43.55] 
[03:31.83] And you know you're my girl!
[03:38.93] Such a classic girl...
[03:50.28] Such a classic girl...
[04:01.28] 
[04:01.15] Yeah for us these are the days...
